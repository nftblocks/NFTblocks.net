/**
 * Each of us wants to stand out and leave our own mark in history.
 * Unfortunately, not everyone has an opportunity to do so.
 * You can draw graffiti on the wall but anyone else can remove it.
 * You can start your own business and make it into a global company.
 * But will it still be around in 100 years?
 * There are hundreds of examples in real life where you can try to leave your mark only for it to be erased.
 * But what if you have the desire to leave something lasting after you?
 * We have an answer. Go to the digital world!
 * Our solution is «NFTblocks», an online game with a whole crypto city,
 * which will expand into the whole crypto world in the near future.
